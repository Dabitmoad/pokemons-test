Hello Mr.Imad Boumzaoued,

For the technical part of this project I work with the nextJs with TypesScript frameWork of React, I decided to work with SSR because it's much more performant than CSR.and because the project is very simple I use the context API for the management system, also I try to separate the functionality and the render trying to use MVVM PATTERN

for the second question, there are many improvements that I want to do to this app and especially on the UI/UX part to do better design.

for the last question, I will do better UI and add more functionality.

I want to share the presentation of my last project that I build in AjiCreative to see the presentation of the project you can visit https://en.beegup.com/
ps: the project is not in production mode the link that I show you just the presentation, not the project.

I have a feed back that there is a problem in API you share with me there alote of things that missing (like images of the pokemons in get pokemon...).
